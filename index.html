        <h2 id="first-post">First post - COVID-19 Lockdown</h2>
        <time datetime="2020-03-25">Posted on 25th of March</time>
        
        <p>I am off work for 3 weeks due to COVID-19 outbreak so I decided to learn something. I've started coding like 3 times now but lack of time (and laziness) has stopped me from continuing so I'm hoping this time I will get a bit further ahead.<br>I try to keep a normal routine in lockdown - wake up at 7am get dressed etc, go for a walk most evenings for our allowed 1 hour of outside exercise. Go shopping once a week. And learning this to make good use of my time but also not to be bored or run out of things to do.<br> So far I've learned about all kinds of tags, values and properties but I keep forgetting what is what. Tags are the easiest. I just need to use their proper names more.

        <p>Today I am making this blog. Maybe it's not a bad idea to write down my coding journey. Even if it seems cringey now. And probably later too. I've never had a proper diary, well, not since I was 6 years old.</p>

        <p>Maybe I have got a knack for this now. I do find typing difficult as I have never used these keys so much.</p>

        <p>I'm hoping this is not a waste of time.</p>
